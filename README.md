# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Analysis of crowdfunding data from Kickstarter was analyzed to determine how launch date and funding goals influenced the success rate of campaigns to fund plays. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to determine if the success rate of crowdfunding campaigns for plays is related to the campaign launch date and or the funding goals established to improve chances of a successful campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The line graph on Graph Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png was generated to evaluate the behavior of theater campaign of outcomes relative to the Month the campaign was launched. The month of May had the most campaigns overall with 166 campaigns launched and the greatest number of successful campaigns with 111 successful campaigns. June followed closely with 100 successful campaigns out of the 153 campaigns launched. There was a spike in failed campaigns in October relative to September and December. December had the least number of campaigns launched and nearly equal number of successful (37) and failed (35) campaigns. The number of campaigns canceled was relatively constant except for the month of October where there were no canceled campaigns. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The line graph on Outcomes_vs_Goals.png was generated to evaluate the rate of success of play campaigns based on the monetary goal. Campaigns with goals lower then $5000 to $10000 had a higher percentage of success than campaign goals of $10000 up.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The database contains data from multiple countries that is not accounted for and that could provide further insight to funding patterns. Also, the Graph Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch  analysis includes musical, play and spaces, campaign goals might be very different between these and might affect the success outcomes. 

## Results

In summary, the best time of the year to launch a successful theater related crowdsourcing campaign is between May and June. Entrepreneurs should avoid launching campaigns in December since successful and failed campaign are at the same level. Also, to increase the likelihood of success, campaign goals should be kept below the $5000 and $10000 range. 
Although the kickstarter data set provided for analysts contains 9 years of data, for years 2009 and 2017 not all 12 months are represented, and it cannot be determined if this is because of the time range used to pull the data or because there are no campaigns initiated over the missing months. The later seems unlikely based on Graph Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png.
To further understand the impact of the launch date on success, I recommend generating a graph comparing the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for each subcategory of theater (musicals, play and spaces) per month. Furthermore, filtering this data by country would help identify specific country related trends.
